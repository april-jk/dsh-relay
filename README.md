Cloud Relay for the DSH mobile remote-control MVP.

Public production endpoint: `https://relay.dshmobile.online`

## Local

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

The default listener is `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. Set `DATABASE_PATH` to a persistent location in production. The Relay expects HTTPS/WSS in any public deployment and routes 0.1.3 sealed tunnel frames without receiving DSH plaintext.

## Releases

Every pull request and branch push installs locked dependencies, builds, tests, and audits the Relay in GitHub Actions. A tag that exactly matches the version in both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (for example, `v0.1.3`) creates a GitHub Release automatically.

Each release contains `.tar.gz` and `.zip` archives with the compiled `dist/` output, deployment files, and production dependency manifests, plus `SHA256SUMS`. After extracting an archive, run `npm ci --omit=dev` before `npm start`; native dependencies are installed for the target platform instead of being bundled from CI.

## Railway

Create a Railway service from this directory, set `JWT_SECRET` to a long random value, and attach a persistent volume mounted at `/data`. Set `DATABASE_PATH=/data/relay.sqlite`. Add an HTTPS custom domain such as `relay.dshmobile.online` and use it as the Relay base URL in the mobile app and Companion. The Companion automatically converts an `https://` Relay URL to `wss://` for its device connection.

Set `TRUST_PROXY=1` on Railway so rate limiting uses the first address supplied by Railway's trusted proxy. Leave it disabled when exposing the Node process directly.

Set `PUBLIC_RELAY_URL=https://relay.dshmobile.online` so ticket responses return the canonical `wss://` client tunnel. Keep `ALLOW_LEGACY_WEB_PROXY=0` in production; enabling it re-opens the deprecated plaintext `/s` proxy for local migration tests only.

The MVP is intentionally single-instance. SQLite volume persistence and a single Relay replica are required until a shared store is introduced.

## Private deployment with Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set a long random `JWT_SECRET`, then start the single-instance Relay:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
```

Put an HTTPS reverse proxy in front of port `8787`. Keep `TRUST_PROXY=0` unless that proxy overwrites client forwarding headers. The `relay-data` volume contains SQLite state and must be backed up. In the mobile app, choose **Relay 服务器** and enter the public HTTPS origin; start DSH with the same origin in `DSH_RELAY`.

## Resource limits

The Relay rejects oversized requests before forwarding them and uses bounded in-memory rate and concurrency tracking. Defaults are suitable for an MVP deployment and can be adjusted through environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Scope |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `MAX_API_BODY_BYTES` | 65,536 | JSON API request body |
| `MAX_TUNNEL_BODY_BYTES` | 2,097,152 | One forwarded HTTP request |
| `MAX_TUNNEL_RESPONSE_BYTES` | 33,554,432 | One forwarded HTTP response |
| `MAX_WS_PAYLOAD_BYTES` | 4,194,304 | One incoming WebSocket frame |
| `MAX_PENDING_HTTP_PER_DEVICE` | 32 | Concurrent HTTP tunnels per computer |
| `MAX_TUNNEL_WS_PER_DEVICE` | 16 | Concurrent WebSocket tunnels per computer |
| `MAX_PENDING_HTTP_GLOBAL` | 512 | Concurrent HTTP tunnels per Relay instance |
| `MAX_TUNNEL_WS_GLOBAL` | 256 | Concurrent WebSocket tunnels per Relay instance |
| `API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | 300 | API requests per client address |
| `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | 20 | Additional authentication limit per client address |
| `PAIR_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | 30 | Additional pairing limit per client address |
| `TUNNEL_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | 600 | Forwarded HTTP requests per client address |
| `WS_UPGRADE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | 120 | WebSocket upgrades per client address |

Rate counters are intentionally instance-local, matching the single-instance MVP architecture. Expired refresh tokens, pairing sessions, access sessions, and events are cleaned at startup and every 15 minutes.

## Mobile release policy

The public `GET /app/version?platform=android|ios` endpoint drives update prompts in the mobile app. Configure each platform independently:

```bash
APP_ANDROID_LATEST_VERSION=0.2.0
APP_ANDROID_MINIMUM_VERSION=0.1.3
APP_ANDROID_DOWNLOAD_URL=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.apriljk.dshremote
APP_ANDROID_RELEASE_NOTES=Improved remote session stability.
APP_IOS_LATEST_VERSION=0.2.0
APP_IOS_MINIMUM_VERSION=0.1.3
APP_IOS_DOWNLOAD_URL=https://apps.apple.com/app/id0000000000
APP_IOS_RELEASE_NOTES=Improved remote session stability.
```

Raise `LATEST_VERSION` for a dismissible prompt. Raise `MINIMUM_VERSION` only when older builds must be blocked. Always configure a valid platform download URL before raising either version.
